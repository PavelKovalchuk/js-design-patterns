/**
 * In object-oriented programming (OOP),
 * a factory is an object for creating other objects â€“
 * formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of
 * a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be "new".
 *
 * When to Use?

 When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic,
 it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.
